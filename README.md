Custom Quick Edit Fields
=====================================================

 I Need to thank  <strong>bamadesigner</strong> because I used her plugin and tutorial to start mine. 
 See her plugin here => 
 https://github.com/bamadesigner/manage-wordpress-posts-using-bulk-edit-and-quick-edit/blob/master/manage_wordpress_posts_using_bulk_edit_and_quick_edit.php
 
  
 <strong>SETTINGS</strong> :  
 * Change the Field Name
 * Change the column Id
 * Change the column visible Name
 * If you want you can costumize the input type for each field
 
  
You can take this code and paste it into your <strong>functions.php</strong> file.
There is an included javascript file used in the 
<tt>CQEF_admin_print_scripts_edit()</tt> function, 
check you're using the right path and setting 
(you have to set it different if you're using this as plugin or copy-paste in function.php).

If you find any issues please let me know. Thanks!
